                                    How To Plot with Pandas

In this Module Challenge we were working on how to plot with Matplotlib.  I am new to this type of computational data and I wanted to show how much I have learned throughout this course.  There are items that were in this assignment that were rather difficult for me to do no matter how much time was spent.  

Working on merging data and loc functions is really beneficial as it gives me a better understanding of how to use them
The groupby has helped me throughout multiple exercises.

I struggled with Quartiles, so unfortunately that part was not included.  My hope is that the team that grades this can actually show me what I should have done to get the results that were asked.

Other than that, I followed most of the instructions.
